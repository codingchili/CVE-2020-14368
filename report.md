- Report target: Eclipse CHE deployment available on che.openshift.io
- Vulnerability type: Cross-site websocket hijack
- Discovery date: 2020-04-08

# Description

This report concerns a cross-site websocket hijack in Theia IDE due to missing security constraints on the /service websocket endpoint. This vulnerability allows an attacker to access the workspace API's, which includes spawning a terminal in the container running the Theia IDE. To explit this vulnerability an attacker needs to know the endpoint to the Theia server, depending on deployment this might be as simple as `localhost` or a public domain. In the case of `che.openshift.io` the websocket endpoint is accessible through a randomly generated DNS ingress adress.

This vulnerability cannot be reproduced in all deployments of Eclipse CHE as its dependent on the authentication mechanism. When using browser-based cookies for example with the SameSite cookie attribute properly configured, requests to establish a websocket from third-party domains will be unsuccessful (if cookie authentication is properly implemented for the deployment). The deployment on `che.openshift.io` uses cookies for authentication but does not set the SameSite attribute, which opens up for cross-site attacks.

# Scenario

On the `che.openshift.io` platform, the websocket endpoint on `/services` is accessible through the openshift clusters ingress address. This address cannot (to the extent of my knowledge) be deduced without performing a man-in-the-middle attack. Depending on how Eclipse CHE is deployed the URL endpoint of the websocket endpoint may be easily guessable.

An example attack scenario on the `che.openshift.io` platform, could occur as follows

1) An attacker retrieves the address of the ingress router of the openshift cluster. This can be done using a passive man-in-the-middle attack to sniff DNS queries - which often are sent in plaintext or to sniff SNI records (target URL) of TLS connections.

More information on man-in-the-middle attacks here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack

There is a test here: https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl/encrypted-sni/ to determine if the current settings for a browser uses secure DNS or leaks SNI information for reference.

2) The attacker injects JavaScript into the victims browser, this can be done if the victim visits a site that is not served over HTTPS if MITM is already established. Other means of having the victim run the payload could be through sending an email with a link to a third-party domain which executes a script that connects to the `/services` websocket endpoint of the ingress.

3) The attacker has full access to the victims workspace through the `/services` endpoint, which includes full filesystem access of the container running Eclipse CHE. The attacker can then using the workspace API's spawn a new terminal for shell access as well, reading and modifying anything contained within the workspace. The attacker may then escape the container environment by stealing GIT credentials or embedding vulnerabilities in the source code, by including third-party dependencies etc.

This is a high-severity vulnerability as it completely allows the workspace to get compromised, it is however not trivial to exploit as it requires (to the extent of my knowledge at time of writing) a man-in-the-middle attack to deduce the address of the ingress router.

# Proof of concept

There are two proof-of-concepts, one minimal to verify that the vulnerability and another interactive which creates and attaches a new terminal to the vulnerable environment. Both versions of the proof-of-concept requires the routers ingress address to be known in advance.

## Simple - using chrome developer tools

1) open Google chrome and browse to `che.openshift.io`.
2) open Chrome developer tools using the menu -> more tools -> developer tools or press Alt+Shift+I. 
3) browse to `che.openshift.io`, authenticate using any provider. (I choose GitHub)
4) go to the network tab in the developer tools, filter out websocket connections with the "WS" button.
5) right click on the connection to "/services" and copy the url. 
    - (example: wss://routen0vpcnaq-codingchili-che.b542.starter-us-east-2a.openshiftapps.com/services)
6) open a new tab and browse to `about:blank` and open the developer tools again.
7) open the console tab and paste the following JavaScript

```javascript
let ws = new WebSocket("wss://routen0vpcnaq-codingchili-che.b542.starter-us-east-2a.openshiftapps.com/services");

ws.onopen = () => {
 ws.send(JSON.stringify({kind: "open", id: "1", path: "/services/shell-terminal"}));
}

ws.onmessage = (e) => {
  console.log(e.data);
}

```

Replace the url with the one copied from the developer tools and press enter.
After a few seconds the following should be printed to the console 

```javascript
{"kind":"ready","id":"1"}
```

Which indicates that the connection was successful from a third-party domain and that the `/services` endpoint accepted the request and opened the shell-terminal API's for JSON RPC invocations. The JavaScript code works on any domain that doesn't enable any additional cross-site features throgh the use of HTML headers.

## Extended - interactive which drops to shell

```html

```

1) deploy the attached proof of concept on a third-party domain, locally (python -m http.server) or just open the .html file. 
2) browse to che.openshift.io authenticate, and open a workspace in eclipse CHE.

The PoC is interactive and will gain shell access over the /services websocket.

Retrieve the websocket domain for the /services endpoint and type "/connect <domain>" in the PoC.
I'm not sure if there's an easy way for an attacker to determine the ingress router address.

The domain can be retrieved using developer tools in chrome, started before loading the theia workspace or pressing F5, check the "Network" tab then filter on websockets to find the one connecting to /services and copy the domain name and paste into the exploit. The domain will look similar to "routecoobb1ln-<username>-che.b542.<region>.openshiftapps.com".

When the websocket is connected it'll print the message "use /attach to attach to a terminal", type "/attach maven" or use the dynamic theia-ide* in the exploit to attach the terminal to a container. If successful you'll see the message "terminal attached successfully" and "bash-4.4 /projects $", type "ls -l" or any other unix command to have it run in the server workspace.

Make sure that the third-party domain hosting the exploit code doesn't enable any x-site security features which could block the websocket connection. Sometimes it takes a few seconds for the websocket to connect. The PoC is tested in Google Chrome.
